# Multiple-Disease-Model

This project used Linear Regression and Support Vector Machine to generate Model. We have trained Datasets of 3-different disease (Diabetes, Heart and Parkinsons) that is why it is called Multiple-Disease-Model

So we have downloaded datasets of all 3 disease from kaggle and trained a model on that datasets.
